            <p class="subhead">New York City is home to almost 8.3 million humans and more than 600,000 dogs.
There are more dogs in NYC than there are people in the state of Wyoming or the country of Iceland. But what do we really know about these four-pawed fellows?</p>

        <p>Walking a dog in a sunny park has been an iconic part of the New York lifestyle for decades. But when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down other city activities, this one seemed more appealing than ever. In 2020, New Yorkers were stuck in lockdowns, dreaming of new family members. And as we know, this is the city where dreams tend to come true—soon, the number of yearly dog licenses peaked.</p>

        <p>People have pets everywhere—big city, lots of pets! Actually, the pet-to-human ratio in NYC is lower than in some other areas of the U.S. But still, 600,000 dogs is a lot! The state of Wyoming has 576,851 human residents, and the entire population of Iceland is 387,558.

        And what about the cats? Wouldn’t it be more relevant to compare NYC dogs to NYC cats rather than the humans of Iceland? Maybe—but unfortunately, NYC does not require cat owners to register their four-pawed fellows, so the total number of cats in the city remains as mystical as a cat’s mind.

        New York’s big dog society is also a huge business. People make money as dog walkers and dog sitters. Dogs have their own daycare centers and stores dedicated to leashes, food, and clothes.

        Alejandro Bastidas has worked as a dog groomer in New York for four years. In his dog salon, located in Harlem, he offers grooming, bathing, and nail care services for dogs. In a typical week, he has approximately 30 clients.

        “Returning clients visit us every 6–8 weeks. They get a full grooming service: bath, haircut, nail trim, teeth brushing, and ear cleaning. On the other hand, clients who only need a bath come back every 4 weeks,” Bastidas explains.</p>

        <p>“Goldendoodle, Shih Tzu, Yorkie, Maltese, Cockapoo, Golden Retriever…” Alejandro starts a long list of the most common breeds he has as clients.

        Of course, groomers have a unique view of the city’s dog scene—some breeds have fur that requires more maintenance than others. In general, New York is a big city with small dogs. The three most popular breeds are all small: Yorkshire Terrier, Shih Tzu, and Chihuahua. And this makes sense, especially if you need to travel between boroughs.

        The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has a rule: On the subway or bus, all pets must be in a bag or other container and carried in a way that doesn’t annoy other riders.</p>

        <p>Odie, Coco, Capri—the dogs gathered in this Harlem groomer are very typical New York City dog names: they all have two syllables and a cute vibe. Coco is the most common of these three; she has more than 4,600 namesakes in dog license data. Between 2014 and 2023, 204 Odie dogs got their licenses. Capri is the rarest of these three—only 41 Capris appear in the NYC dog license data.</p>

        <p>But where are all these doggos actually located? It seems that the main dog district of NYC is the Upper West Side. So if you are a dog lover without your own dog, I recommend a walk in Central Park or Riverside Park—you're guaranteed to see a lot of different kinds of dogs. Or if you’re a dog owner looking for friends for you and your four-pawed life partner, here are some tips on where to go.</p>
